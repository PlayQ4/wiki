## How does our Discord work?
Hey, welcome to PlayQ4.net :D

[We](../pq4/playq4_en.md) are a Quake 4 community mainly centered around our [Discord Server](http://www.playq4.net/discord). Our goal is to maintain an active player base competing for our leaderboard.

### How to search for matches?
In contrast to many other arena shooter Discord Servers that use [PUBobot2](https://github.com/Leshaka/PUBobot2), we have tried a more user-friendly approach by implementing our own [queue system](../pq4/queue_en.md).

![image](https://github.com/PlayQ4/wiki/assets/69087944/5fefbf1e-8e42-4484-bd32-ba614a8ebb5c)

- To `add` to the queue, you can click the buttons ([`Duel`](../q4/modes/duel_en.md), [`TDM`](../q4/modes/tdm_en.md), or [`CTF`](../q4/modes/ctf_en.md)) seen below the message.
- If you want to `leave` the queue, you need to click the `Remove` button.
- If you want to tell other players that you are actively searching for a [match](../q4/match_en.md), clicking the `Promote!` button will notify everyone, with the corresponding role, on our Discord.

Once a match has started, a new thread will get created where you can chat with all other players in your match (for `Duel`, this will only be you and the enemy player).

### How to ask for help?
- You can get general help on our [Discord](http://www.playq4.net/discord) where other users can try to answer your questions in our [`#help-and-feedback`](https://discord.com/channels/834908433073045604/1034581958895865866) forum.
- If you want to report a bug or suggest new features, you can do so [here](https://github.com/PlayQ4/issues).

## Quake 4

### First-time setup
If you're new to our servers or launching the game for the first time, you need to install [Q4Max](../q4max/q4max_en.md). You can do this by installing our [launcher](../pq4/launcher_en.md), which comes prepackaged with Q4Max, or by manually installing it [here](https://www.moddb.com/downloads/start/36857?referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.moddb.com%2Fmods%2Fq4max%2Fdownloads).

> [!NOTE]
> The launcher is currently only compatible with Windows and the Steam version of Quake 4.

If you choose to install Q4Max manually, unpack `q4max082.zip` and move its contents to your Quake 4 installation directory. Afterwards, add `+set fs_game q4max` to your game's launch arguments.

We also recommend adding `+set com_allowconsole 1` to your launch arguments, as having access to the console can be very helpful.

### Buying Quake 4
If you have yet to buy Quake 4, you can do so on its [Steam page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2210/Quake_4/).

> [!CAUTION]
> While there are third-party resellers where you might find cheaper keys than on Steam, please be cautious when considering alternative sources.

> [!CAUTION] 
> We strongly advise verifying the legitimacy of resellers before making any purchases. While these platforms may offer lower prices, be aware of potential risks.
